	<p>Sparks flew at the Panel for Educational Policy's monthly public meeting, at MS 131 in Chinatown. The meeting saw a smaller crowd than last month's gathering, which featured heated exchanges over the Culturally Responsive Sustaining Education initiative. But none the less, the meeting saw a small passionate delegation of current and former educators giving a voice to their students.
	</p>
	<p>
	Over all, present educators seemed pleased with the benchmarks the CRSE has proposed putting forward. While still finding room for critiques especially when it comes to students from low income and minority neighborhoods.
	</p>
	<p>
	"Ladies and gentleman, I don't know why this is happening, but please wake up and smell the coffee,"" said Gerard Schriffen, a former educator and current attorney. "Take look at an empty room. Take a look at what's happening in New York City."

	<p>His sentiments were met with applause as other educators in the room shared in his outrage. 
    </p>
	<p>
	Megan Moskop, a special education teacher from Manhattan, took to the microphone during the talk back portion of the evening to voice her concern over the pressure put on students.  Many who feel gaining acceptance into one of the coveted gifted programs throughout the city is their ticket to a better future.
    </p>
    <p>
	"I think the gifted and talented program functions as a tool to stress out four year-olds and then continues up through the system," said Moskop, 33. "Until they become adults who are stressed and working in jobs that may or may not be fulfilling."
    </p>
    <p>
	Annie Tan, a fellow special education teacher, concurred with Moskop adding that she herself had experienced the mental pitfalls of the screening process.

	Tan grew up in Chinatown and remembers the emphasis put on gaining admission into a gifted high school. But she cautioned, that though the process is stressful, she was one of the lucky ones. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Tan came from an area with multiple gifted high schools to aspire to. While children in low incoming and predominantly black and latinx neighborhoods have less access and opportunity to attend such institutions. 
	</p>
	<p>
	"When you label a kid special ed or label a kid, a specialized high school kid," Tan said, "they, like keep that label, and they internalize that, and it effects their identity and their education moving forward."

		Another shared feeling, from many of the educators in attendance, was that eliminating gifted and talented programs could cause parents to pull their children from the public school system and seek better educations for them in the private sector. This in turn would take away much need funding from public schools, leaving the very children CRSE hopes to enrich behind.
	</p>
	<p>
	Despite these fears, Moskop and Tan agreed, that replacing gifted and talented programs with in school support provides an alternative that could reach a greater diversity of students. Students, who would have otherwise been left out of contention for gifted and talented programs.
	</p>
	<p>
	In his closing words to the Panel, Schriffen, 73 offered a chilling but welcomed reminder on the gumption of NYC Public School students. One that his fellow educators spent the night spelling out.
	</p>
	<p>
	"I never met a child that was not able to be educated. Never. The worst student, as far as performance, I've seen that child excel," said Schriffen, 73. "Lets never blame the students."
